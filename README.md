# RockPaperScissors
A rock, paper, scissors game.

## The Game
"Rock Paper Scissors" is a game where two participants each choose to display (usually with simultaneous hand motions) "rock" or "paper" or "scissors".   


### Winning Conditions
The winner is chosen on the basis of what each participant chooses to display.
- "Rock" looses to "Paper"
- "Paper" looses to "Scissors"
- "Scissors" looses to "Rock"    


Both participants displaying the same sign results in a draw.  

## Program Objectives
This text-based game was created for a single, first-player perspective. 

The player can either choose to play against a computer or play against another human. (Since the other human will be using the same computer, this mode is only recommended for learning the rules of the game.)

### MVP Requirements
#### Features
- Have a main menu with options for either a 2 player game or to play against the computer.
- When the game is over, the winner should be declared.
#### Technical
- Use classes to remove repetitive parts of the code.
- Create an abstract player class to manage the state of the player.
- Handle incorrect capitalization of otherwise valid input.
- Each class should have methods associated with it and be instantiated as an object.
- Get standard input using a ```Scanner```
- Use arrays or array lists to store game history.

### Bonus Options
- Automated JUnit tests.
- Use an Agile project management framework.
- Use packages to modularize code.
- Use generics on collections to store different data composed of different types.
- Use multithreading to handle concurrent requests.
- Incorporate video, text, data, networking, and sound using ```Processing```

## Technologies Used
- Java 11 was the only language used in this project.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository to a local computer.
- Open up an IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA) and run the Main method class in the RockPaperScissors package.
